CWRU has a serious problem
====================================

**The academic integrity policy at Case Western Reserve University does not work.**

Academic integrity is the basis of the value of _every_ degree given by Case Western.
Without a strong belief in an institution's principles of academic integrity, employers, the community, and other academic institutions cannot trust that graduates are equipped with the skills they claim to possess.

Why doesn't the academic integrity policy work?
---------------------------------
For a number of reasons:
* Professors do not have the time, nor motivation, to pursue offenders.
* Students do not hold each other accountable for integrity.
* It is the exception, rather than the rule, for students to report each other for cheating. _This is the cornerstone of an honor code, and a culture that CWRU desperately needs._

How can we fix it?
---------------------------------
CWRU needs an honor code. An honor code creates a culture of mutual respect, trust, and honesty amongst the CWRU student population.

Cheating is rampant, and students need to hold each other accountable.
Creating a culture of self-enforced honesty will prepare students for the workplace more effectively and create deep feelings of mutual trust and respect.

***This is the culture that current and future CWRU students deserve.***

Tell me more about honor codes:
--------------------------------
[Ohio University's Honor Code](http://www.ohio.edu/students/honor_code/) asks students to
> hold [themselves] to the highest standards of personal honesty and ethical behavior in [their] academic work.
and, if
> if [they] see an instance of academic dishonesty, [to] take the appropriate steps that are consistent with the Honor Code.

[Oberlin College's Honor Code](http://new.oberlin.edu/conservatory/academic-resources-and-support/honor-code.dot) asks students, when submitting each assignment, to remember their commitment to the honor code and thus
> affirming that they have not cheated, plagiarized, fabricated, or falsified information, nor assisted others in these actions.

At Oberlin, the Honor Code places so much trust in students that **professors do not proctor exams.**
